# hangman
Part 4 of 12 beginner python projects by Kylie Ying

## Notes
- Had also took inspiration from [MikhailLenko](https://github.com/MikhailLenko)'s take on [hangman](https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/tree/master/build-hangman-in-python)
- I *surprisingly* had a hard time guessing the correct word, so I increased the number of tries from 6 to 7 XD.
